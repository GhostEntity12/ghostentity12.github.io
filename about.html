			<p>
				I'm James Leung, a game designer and programmer based in Melbourne, Australia. <br /> <br />
				I work mostly in Unity, where I'm proficient in C#. I also have some experience in hard surface modelling, which has allowed me to quickly work on solo prototypes. <br /> <br />
				I usually act as a technical game designer or programmer, though I've also acted as a level designer and a producer on small teams.
