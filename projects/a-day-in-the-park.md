A Day in the Park was made as part of a three day AIE game jam in May of 2020.

### About A Day in the Park
In A Day in the Park, players play as a pigeon named Will trying to collect food in the form of seeds and sandwiches to your nest while avoiding frisbees and an evil magpie named Bidge. Collecting food and bringing it back to the nest rewards the player  with points, while getting hit by Bidge or a frisbee will cause Will to lose a life. The player's goal is to get as high of a score as possible before Will loses all three of his lives.

### My Role
I primarily acted as level designer for this project, setting up the playspace and seeding the level with pickups, as well as designing the in-game UI, and assisting in programming in some of the UI functionality towards the end of development.
