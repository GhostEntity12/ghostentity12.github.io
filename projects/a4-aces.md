A4 Aces is a Google Cardboard VR game which was developed over the course of five weeks in May and June of 2020.

### About A4 Aces
A4 Aces's core concept is paper plane dogfighting game and offers both singleplayer and online multiplayer modes across two different maps. In singleplayer mode, players fly around and fire pins at red balloons, earning score for each balloon they hit. In the multiplayer mode, players are instead aiming to take out each other. In both modes, players have a limited number of pins and must fly into the pin boxes scattered around the map to restock their ammo.

### My Role
I acted as the sole programmer for this rather challenging project, as well as designing the mechanics and UI. The game was initially planned to use Unity's deprecated UNet multiplayer networking system, but after development started, I found that it lacked some of the functionality required and restarted the project using Photon. Alongside programming the online multiplayer, I also designed the rooms that are used in the menu and game over screens, placed the ammo pickups in both of the maps, modelled the assets that were used for blockouts, and programmed the UI, pickups, firing and gyro-controlled player movement.
