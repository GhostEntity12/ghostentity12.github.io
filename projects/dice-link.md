Dice Link was made in 48 hours as part of the **[2022 GMTK Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-jam-2022)** for the theme *Roll of the Dice*.

### About Dice Link
Dice Link is a puzzle game where the player must draw a line through dice with the same symbol to score points. The different symbols on the dice provide different bonuses when linked together, for example, the pears symbol also clears all pears on the board, coins provide bonus points and water drops clear a large column around the final die. Additionally, there is a bonus die, which provides a score multiplier if it has the same icon as the dice the player is linking up.

The game also features a shop where in game currency earned by playing the game can be spent on customisation to change the appearance of the dice in-game.

### My Role
I acted as a designer and the programmer for Dice Link, concepting the mechanics of the game and implementing all of the systems, which included the matching system, score tracking, dice customisation and shop integration.

As part of the currency and customisation implementation, I also implemented encryption of the save file to prevent players from giving themselves currency or unlocking customisation by editing the file.
