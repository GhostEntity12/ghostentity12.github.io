Dispirited was a small Action/Party game developed over four weeks in April and May 2020 as part of my Advanced Diploma at AIE.

In Dispirited, up to three spirits face off against a hero who is attempting claim points by staying in a certain area for a certain amount of time. The hero was equipped with a melee attack and a powerful enemrgy burst that would forcefully push away spirits, and the spirits had a projectile and a ranged attack. If a spirit managed to a melee killing blow on the hero, they turn into the new hero, and are now the one trying to fend off the other spirits - who now include the previous hero.

I acted as the sole programmer for this project, implementing everything from menus to UI to gameplay, though I also helped out where required, including rigging and animating the spirit, designing additional mechanics for balancing, and the attack and some environmental particle systems.
