duo was made in 48 hours as part of the 2021 GMTK Game Jam.

### About duo
duo is a puzzle game where the player controls two avatars at once, trying to get them both to a goal tile. Both avatars move identically from the same input but can only interact with certain items and walls - the red character can only interact with and be stopped by red items and the blue character, blue items. Players can interact with buttons and switches which can make walls appear and disappear or even swap the positions of players

### My Role
I was the sole programmer on duo, and also worked on some of the level design and the UI/2D art.

As the programmer, I implemented a extendable system to manage the inputs (switches and buttons) and outputs (walls, etc.) in the game, and implemented the menu system which prevented players from trying later levels before they had finished the previous levels.

With my level design, I focused on creating levels which would guide and teach the player to learn the mechanics of the game without the use of any tutorial modal boxes. I was responsible for all the levels except levels 10, 12 and 13
