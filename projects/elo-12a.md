ELO-12⍺ is a vertical slice which was developed solo over the course of 5 weeks in 2019.

### About ELO-12⍺
In ELO-12⍺ players control Kira Walters, a human living on the planet Kepler-422b, or Eleos, in the 29th century. While out exploring in her buggy, she comes across a abandoned structure and decides to explore it. The vertical slice explores the first part Kira's exploration in the titular ELO-12⍺.

### My Role
ELO-12⍺ would have been a mix of point-and-click and Metroidvania gameplay, as the station would have been packed tightly together and connected by doors which required different keycards and Kira would frequently come across doors she couldn't yet access. For the project, I modelled meshes including benches, books, lamps and keycards, as well as modelling, rigging and animating a humanoid character. I also coded in click-to-move movement, an inventory/pickup system and a rudimentary keypad system.
