Ghost Stories was developed in February 2022 over the course of a week as part of the **[Brackeys 2022.1 Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/brackeys-7)**.

### About Ghost Stories
Ghost Stories is a short exploration-based adventure game, where the player explores a town of ghosts, investigating a mystery involving a whispered-about monster and missing children. If the player keeps their eyes open, they may find clues that lead to a secret ending.

### My Role
I mainly acted as the programmer for the project, creating a simple pickup system and character controller. 

As well as the code, I also created the shaders we used, designed the particle systems, designed and implemented the UI, and created the main menu and the secret ending scenes.
