Good Hex is Hard to Find is being developed as a capstone project by a Swinburne University of Technology student team, and will be exhibited at PAX Australia 2022 at the Swinburne booth. The project began in March and is expected to wrap up in late October.

### About Good Hex is Hard to Find
In Good Hex is Hard to Find, the player commands an group of rats, co-ordinating them to attempt to resurrect their witch owner. The player assigns rats to do tasks which include planting seeds, gathering potion ingredients and moving levers.

The game features a beautiful handpainted artstyle which blends 2D and 3D art together.

### My Role
My role on Good Hex was as a Technical Gameplay Designer, working with the other designers to concept both general and level mechanics and then with the programming team to implement them. I was involved in creating early prototypes of systems and then iterating and polishing them through tester feedback.

Mechanics I worked on included creating systems that managed rat movement and assignment to tasks, rat behaviour, UI functionality, and the many different types of task.

The project also makes use of a lightly modified version of the dialogue system I originally created for **[Welcome to the Apocalypse](/projects/welcome-to-the-apocalypse)**
