House Hunting was developed as a capstone project by a Swinburne University of Technology student team, and was exhibited at PAX Australia 2023 at the Swinburne booth. The project was in development between March and late October 2023.

### About House Hunting
In House Hunting, the player takes on the role of a hunter, but instead of hunting animals, they hunt furniture, which they bring back to their house to decorate with. The game features over 50 pieces of unique furniture which spawn randomly across the world's four biomes. Some furniture can only spawn in specific biomes, such as couches spawning in the plains, or fridges spawning in the snowy mountains.

### My Role
For House Hunting, I acted as the lead programmer, and acted as a bridge for communication between the designers and programmers. My duties included writing process documents, creacting specs, and reviewing pull requests made by other members of the team. I also contributed to development of several mechanics and features, including the campfire quick-travel system, a modular AI system, and menus and UI.
