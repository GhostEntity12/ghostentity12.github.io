ISLAND was a solo project developed in 2018 as part of my undertaking of the Certificate III of Screen and Media, and was the first game that I developed start to finish.

### About ISLAND
In ISLAND, you control a robot named i5-LND, collecting items from chests to reach the mountain and discover what it hides.

### My Role
ISLAND was my first time properly creating a 3D game and was developed in Unreal Engine 4, making use of Unreal's Blueprints system.
