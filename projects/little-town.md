Little Town was a 5 week long solo project created in Feburary and March of 2020 as part of my Advanced Diploma at AIE. 

### About Little Town
In Little Town, the player helps a town grow by assigning the inhabitants of the town to work in either the farms, the forest, the mines, or the mill, once it's unlocked. Workers at each location provide food to keep the townspeople fed, or wood and metals to help expand the town or upgrade facilities. At the end of each day, there is a chance for random events to occur, each of which can increase or decrease the player's stockpiles of resources or even change the number of people in the town.

### My Role
As well as programming the mechanics of the game and modelling some basic low-poly houses, fields and buildings, I also included a feature where the number of houses was accurately represented in-game, and also featured small models of people moving randomly around the town.
