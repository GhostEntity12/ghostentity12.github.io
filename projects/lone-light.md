Lone Light is a University prototype project developed from August to October in 2021

### About Lone Light
Lone Light is a platforming game where the player takes control of a ball of light, slaying creatures of darkness and consuming them in order to cleanse the darkness. After devouring a certain number of souls, the player can claim a boon at the wellspring, which permanently upgardes their abilities.

### My Role
For Lone Light, I acted mainly as a programmer, creating and implementing the UI, including the title screen, implementing some animations, writing the code for enemy AI, and the system for handing out temporary and permanent bonuses.
