Monday Riot was developed as part of a three day AIE game jam in March 2020.

### About Monday Riot
Monday Riot is a 2-4 player last-player-standing party game where players pick up and throw office furniture at each other. Each piece of furniture would slow down the player and deal damage to the player based on how heavy it was. Rounds would go for 90 seconds or until there was only one player remaining, and the first player to win three rounds won the game.

### My Role
I acted mainly as the sole artist for this project, modelling all the office equipment that was in the game. I also aided with the level layout and helped to code some of the in-game UI.
