Motherduck was a level design exercise which took place early on in my Diploma at AIE where we had to create a level for a game named Motherduck. Our level was based on Flagstaff Gardens.

In Motherduck, two players face off to try and round up as many ducks as possible over the course of four rounds. Getting within a certain distance of a duck causes it to start following the player. Players can also steal ducks from the other player if they get close enough to the ducks following the other player. At the end of each round, all the ducks are reset and a new clone of each player moves through the level, repeating the movements of the previous round, also collecting ducks if they get close enough. Players can also steal ducks off of these clones.

I created the initial sketch that the level was based on, as well as assigning the places for the ducks, implementing physics objects, and was responsible for a polish pass on most of the meshes. I also took over as Producer after our previous producer had to leave due to circumstances out of his control.
