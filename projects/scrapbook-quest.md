Scrapbook Quest was developed in February 2023 over the course of a week as part of the **[Brackeys 2023.1 Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/brackeys-9)**. Scrapbook Quest placed #36 overall out of the 735 games in the game jam, and placed #12 in the Innovation category.

### About Scrapbook Quest
In Scrapbook Quest, players take control of a RPG hero slaying monsters in a child's notebook, eith the goal of levelling up to level 10, or as high as possible in endless mode. The world in the notebook is made up of a grid of tiles, which are regenerated after the player has moved a certain number of tiles. 

Some tiles have features like towns or farms that heal the player, or chests that improve the player's stats. The player also receives stat buffs or debuffs depending on what tiles they are standing on.


### My Role
I acted as the programmer for this project, implementing all of the mechanics, including the pathfinding, generation of the world and combat systems.
