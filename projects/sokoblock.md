Sokoblock was a small solo project developed over the course of a week in 2021.

### About Sokoblock
Sokoblock is a implementation of Sokoban developed entirely in Ruby/Gosu. In Sokoban, the player attempts to push a number of crates into the right positions. The program also includes a level editor.

### My Role
Sokoblock was my first real Ruby project, and I made it with the intention to be as lightweight as possible. As a result, I developed it to not make use of any sprites - the Ruby file can be dropped into any folder alongside level files and function immediately. The program uses JSON files to store levels, along with the ability to create and edit levels with an inbuilt level editor, all custom made.
