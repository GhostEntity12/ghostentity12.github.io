Spaceship Link was a one week project developed in February 2021 as part of the **[Brackeys 2021.1 Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/brackeys-5)**.

### About Spaceship Link
Spaceship Link is a co-op twin stick shooter where the closer the two players' ships are, the more damage the players do. Players need to shoot down enemy ships to defend a trio of satellites for as long as possible, gaining score for each ship they destroy.

### My Role
Spaceship Link was mostly a solo project with a bit of help from Nicholas Burke with planning and concepting and Massimo Gamboni with the original concepts for the spaceships. I was responsible for all other parts of the project including UI design, art and implementation, designing and programming the main mechanics, modelling the satellites and the player and enemy spaceships from Massimo's concepts, and particle effects.
