Sunrise Valley Shelter was developed for the [**Brackeys 2024.1 Game Jam**](https://itch.io/jam/brackeys-11/) between February 11 and 18th.

### About Surnise Valley Shelter
In Sunrise Valley Shelter, players foster dogs and cats at their shelter and try to match the animals they meet with people looking to adopt an animal.

### My Role
I acted as the designer and programmer for the project, as well as animating the door opening and reveal scene.
