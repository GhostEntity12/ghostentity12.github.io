Tavern Trashers was developed at the end of 2019 as the final project of my diploma at AIE. Development started in early September and concluded in late November.

### About Taven Trashers
The concept behind Tavern Trashers was simple: a bar fight in which everything could be picked up and thrown. In the game, 2-4 players are able to pick up practically everything around them, from posters on the walls to bottles on the shelves to the tables and chairs and everything on them. They're then able to throw or bash the other players over the head with whatever they picked up - different props would deal different amounts of damage, and some props even had additional properties, such as the ability to block attacks or heal their wielder. The game also featured a mechanic where most of the props were randomly placed each time the level was loaded, meaning no two matches would be the same.

### My Role
At the start of the project I was planned to act as Tavern Trashers' producer, however, we lost our other designer and two of our three programmers due to various circumstances, and I stepped in to help fill those roles. Alongside my production duties, I designed the layout of the tavern, populated the tavern with both items that were consistent every game and places for items to spawn, imported and set up the props in engine, and was responsible for programming the main menu, UI functionality and a realtime stat display which showed how each player was doing on a blackboard in the tavern, along with other smaller bits and pieces. I was also responsible for VFX, including all of the particle systems in the game.
