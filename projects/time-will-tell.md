Time Will Tell was developed in September over the course of a week for the [Brackeys Game Jam 2024.2](https://itch.io/jam/brackeys-12). 

### About Time Will Tell
In Time Will Tell, players take the role of the leader of a kingdom trying to prepare for and weather a destructive storm sweeps through their lands. Players must balance their resources and the knights they have available to them in order to protect as many of their subjects from the storm.

### My Role
I acted as the programmer and a designer for the project, creating and designing the varipus mechanics. I also used this project to explore the creation of tools using Unity's UI Toolkit, creating a Quest Editor which was used to set up and manage the various quests in the game.
