Village of Fate was co-developed by myself and Grant Roberts over the course of three days as part of the GMTK Game Jam 2020.

Each day the game deals the player a hand of cards and a set of dice. Each of the cards has a pair of effects and a threshold. Players assign a die to each card, and on ending the day, one of the effects will occur, depending on whether the die's value was above or below the threshold. The player's goal is to figure out the best way to distribute their dice to their cards and keep the village thriving for as long as possible.

For this project, I mainly took the role of designer and artist, creating the cards and UI, setting up the scene, and implementing the day-night cycle, though I also assisted with some programming, including UI functionality, programming the physics based dice and dealing out the cards.
